# RscriptCollection
 This repo collected the analysis scripts used in my daily research life. It's more like a treasure box of me since the every code i wrote will be recorded here.
 Currently, only a few scripts were presented on git and i will be happy to write the datail usage of each script to make it repproductive for others.
