# RscriptCollection
 This repo collected the analysis scripts used in my daily research life. It's more like a treasure box of me since the every code i wrote will be recorded here.
 Currently, only a few scripts were presented on git and i will be happy to write the datail usage of each script to make it repproductive for others.

## How to contribute

Fork this repo, then add/modify contents according to the [structure](#project-structure).

For scripts with data, you should create a **new folder** then place them in. For single scripts, just live it alone.
